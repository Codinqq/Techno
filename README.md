**Techno**

Techno was the official bot of mine, and it was recently deprecated, because of many bugs.

This is now opensource, and here because I want it to be here, so I can look back at this bot, and maybe in the future I can fix the bot.

> **WARNING** This bot is full of bugs, do not use this if you don't know how to fix bugs, and have experience in discord.js / node.js.

> The token in config.json is not valid, the user with that token was removed when it was deprecated.
